              Welcome to our website, where art and technology collide! Our
              group of programmers, designers, and tech enthusiasts is
              enthusiastic about applying computer science to improve the field
              of digital arts.
              <br /><br />
              Our shared passion for all things digital unites the diverse staff
              of BSCS. With a solid background in innovation and computer
              science, we enjoy pushing boundaries and taking on new challenges.
              Our aim is to simplify the process of artwork display for students
              studying digital arts. To enable students to easily share their
              works of art. Creating simple platforms for the creative community
              is our area of expertise. The website we have created was designed
              solely to allow Digi Arts students to easily display their work.
